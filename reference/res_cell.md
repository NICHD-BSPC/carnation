A `DESeqResults` object testing the difference between two cell lines of
smooth muscle cells

## Format

A `DESeqResults` object, generated in the `DESeq2` framework

## Details

This `DESeqResults` object on the data from the `airway` package has
been created comparing two smooth muscle cell lines, accounting for the
effect of dexamethasone treatment.

Details on how this object has been created are included in the
`create_carnation_data.R` script, included in the `scripts` folder of
the `Carnation` package.
