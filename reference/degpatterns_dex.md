# A `degPatterns` object for differentially expressed genes in the dexamethasone treatment comparison.

A `degPatterns` object for differentially expressed genes in the
dexamethasone treatment comparison.

## Format

A `degPatterns` object, generated with the `degPatterns` function from
the `DEGreport` package.

## Details

This `degPatterns` object was created to test for groups of coexpressed
genes in the top 100 differentially expressed genes from the
dexamethasone treatment comparison.

Details on how this object has been created are included in the
`create_carnation_data.R` script, included in the `scripts` folder of
the `Carnation` package.
