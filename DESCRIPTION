Description: Interactive Shiny dashboard app that can be used to
    explore RNA-Seq analysis results including differential expression (DE),
    functional enrichment and pattern analysis. Several visualizations
    are implemented to provide a wide-ranging view of data sets. For
    DE analysis, we provide PCA plot, MA plot, Upset plot & heatmaps,
    in addition to a highly customizable gene plot.  Seven different
    visualizations are available for functional enrichment analysis,
    and we also support gene pattern analysis. In addition, the app
    provides a platform to manage multiple projects and user groups
    that can be run on a central server.
