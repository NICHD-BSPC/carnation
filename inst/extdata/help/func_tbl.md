#### Enrichment Table
---------------------

This is an interactive table of the results listing functional terms, associated genes and p-values.
This table can be used to search for genes and pathways of interest using the search box at the top
right hand corner.
- The table consists of the following columns:
  - `ID`, `Description`: these are the ID and description of the functional term/pathway
  - `geneID`: comma-separated list of genes associated with the functional term
  - `Count`: number of genes associated with the functional term
  - `pvalue`, `p.adjust`: P-value and adjusted p-value from a hypergeometric test
- The number of genes displayed per line can be adjusted using the `genes per line` control.
  This can be useful to improve the display when many genes are associated with an enriched pathway/term.
