#### y-axis settings
--------------------

Adjust y-axis settings

- Use `y-axis max` & `y-axis min` to set y-axis limits.
   - By default, limits are set to 5% outside the
     range of values.
   - `Autoscale` resets the axis to initial limits.
   - When `sample group` or `Gene scratchpad` is updated,
     these limits are autoscaled if many points are left off
     the plot.
- `log scale`: when checked, the plot shows a log10-scale y-axis (default: on).
- `free y axes`: When this is checked, faceted plots will have
  independent y-axes (default: off).
