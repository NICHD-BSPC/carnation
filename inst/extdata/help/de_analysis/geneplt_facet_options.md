#### facet settings
-------------------

Edit the levels of the selected faceting variable

- `variable`: dropdown menu showing selected facet variable(s)
  - **Note:** this menu will not show `gene` as an option, since
    this can be adjusted using the `Gene scratchpad`.
- `levels` menu can be used to remove specific levels or to change
    the order.
- `Reset` returns the faceting variable to its original state.
