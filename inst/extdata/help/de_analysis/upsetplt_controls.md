#### Upset plot controls

Main controls for UpSet plot

- `Effect class`: choose a particular subset of genes from the gene set based
  on direction of change (`changed`, `upregulated` or `downregulated`).
- `Gene sets to compare`: drag-and-drop control
  to select/deselect gene sets to compare
  - Click and drag gene sets from `current` to `unused` to drop them
    from the comparison. Click and drag in opposite direction to
    add them back.
  - `Select all` moves all gene sets to `current`, i.e. resets the plot
    to the starting condition.
  - `Select none` moves all gene sets to `unused` and empties the plot.
  - On first load, all comparisons are selected and at least two
    comparisons must be selected to generate this plot.
