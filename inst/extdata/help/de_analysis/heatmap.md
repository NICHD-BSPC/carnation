#### Heatmap
------------

Heatmap visualization of top DE genes

- Here we extract and plot normalized expression data in the form
  of a heatmap.
- The gene set depicted in the plot can be defined using the
  `Comparison`, `Effect class` & `Filters` controls.
  - If the number of genes is too large, only the top 100 are
    shown in the plot.
- Genes found in the `Gene scratchpad` are labeled red on the
  side of the heatmap.
