#### Edit metadata
------------------

- Metadata columns can be edited in three ways:
  - `Duplicate column`
  - `Add empty column`
  - `Remove column`

Existing metadata is considered immutable and therefore, *only*
custom columns are editable.

- To edit, double click on a cell and enter the desired value.
- When finished, hit `Enter` while holding down
  the `control` key.

  **Warning**: For multi-page tables, hit `Control+Enter` *before*
  switching pages in order not to lose edits.

- `Apply changes` will propagate edits through the app.
  - Now, custom columns will show up as an option in PCA plot, Gene plot & heatmap.
- To reject changes and reset to the original metadata hit the
  `Reset` button.

- Edits in metadata are only saved during the current
  session. To save changes to metadata, hit `Save changes` in the app header.
