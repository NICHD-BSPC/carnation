#### Interactive PCA Plot
-------------------------

Dynamic visualization of sample relationships using Principal Component Analysis.

**What it shows:**
- Sample clustering based on gene expression patterns
- Major sources of variation in your dataset
- Relationships between experimental conditions

**When to use it:**
- To assess sample quality and identify potential outliers
- To visualize separation between experimental groups
- To explore sources of variation beyond your experimental design

**How to interpret:**
- Samples that cluster together have similar overall expression profiles
- Distance between points represents degree of difference in expression
- The percentage on each axis shows how much variation that principal component explains

**Interactive features:**
- Hover over points to see sample IDs and metadata
- Color points by any metadata variable (or combinations of variables)
- Select different principal components to visualize (PC1-PC6)
- Pan, zoom, and download the current view

**Plot options:**
- `color by`: Select metadata variables to color the samples
- `x-axis`, `y-axis`: Choose which principal components to display
- `sample selection`: Filter samples based on metadata variables
