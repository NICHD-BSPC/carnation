#### Gene scratchpad
--------------------

General-purpose scratch space to make note of genes of interest from plots or tables.

- This is accessible from most areas of the app. Genes selected here will be shown on the
  `Gene plot` and labeled on the `MA plot` & `Heatmap`.
- Genes can be added/removed in several ways:
  - `Add top genes by LFC` will add the top three up- and down-regulated genes from the
    selected comparison (based on `log2FoldChange`).
  - `Add top genes by padj` adds the top 6 genes with the lowest `padj` values.
  - Clicking a row of the table in the DE analysis `Table` tab adds the corresponding gene name here.
  - Comma-separated gene names can be copy-pasted here, e.g. from a functional enrichment table.
  - Gene names can also be typed in directly. Autocomplete options will be shown as you type.
