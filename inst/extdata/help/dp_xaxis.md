#### x-axis settings
--------------------

Adjust the x-axis of the pattern plot

- `variable levels`: drag-and-drop control that can be used
  to change the order of x-axis labels or to drop specific levels.
  - Click and drag levels from `current` to `unused` to drop them
    from x-axis view. Click and drag in opposite direction to
    add them back.
  - Drag levels up or down to change the order of levels.
  - `Select all` moves all levels to `current`, i.e. resets x-axis
    to the original state.
  - `Select none` moves all levels to `unused` and empties the plot.
- `rotate x labels` changes the angle of the x-axis labels and can be used
  to prevent overlapping.
  - Use up and down arrows to increment/decrement the rotation angle in
    steps of 15
