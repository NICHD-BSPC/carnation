#### Gene Plot
--------------

Customizable visualization of expression data for genes of interest selected via the Gene scratchpad.

**What it shows:**
- Expression levels of selected genes across samples
- Relationships between gene expression and experimental conditions
- Individual data points and summary statistics

**When to use it:**
- To examine expression patterns of specific genes of interest
- To create publication-quality visualizations of key findings
- To explore relationships between genes selected from other visualizations

**How to interpret:**
- Each point represents a sample's expression value for a gene
- Boxplots show the distribution of expression values within groups
- Lines connect related samples or show trends across conditions
- Color coding helps distinguish between experimental groups

**Interactive features:**
- Group samples by any metadata variable
- Color points by experimental conditions or any other metadata variable
- Facet the plot by any metadata variable or by gene
- Levels of metadata variables used for grouping or faceting can be edited, e.g.
  to remove specific levels or to change the order in which they are shown
- Add or remove genes using the Gene scratchpad
- Download publication-ready versions of your visualizations

**Note:** Changes to the FDR and LFC thresholds affect all DE analysis visualizations.
