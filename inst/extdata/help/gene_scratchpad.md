#### Gene Scratchpad
--------------------

General-purpose workspace for tracking genes of interest across all visualizations.

**What it shows:**
- List of genes you've selected from various parts of the application
- Quick-add controls for adding top genes from any comparison

**When to use it:**
- To keep track of important genes across different visualizations
- To build a curated list of genes for focused analysis
- To highlight genes of interest in plots throughout the application

**How to add genes:**
- **Quick add:** Add top genes from any comparison based on:
  - Log fold change (most up/downregulated)
  - Statistical significance (lowest adjusted p-values)
- **From tables:** Select rows in the DE analysis table and click "Add to scratchpad"
- **From plots:** Click on points in interactive visualizations
- **Manual entry:** Type gene names directly into the scratchpad

**How genes are used:**
- Highlighted in the MA plot with dark circles
- Labeled in the heatmap visualization with red
- Displayed in the Gene plot for detailed expression analysis
- Filtered in functional enrichment tables
- Shown in UpSet plot intersections
- Labeled in the Pattern analysis plot

**Note:** The Gene scratchpad persists throughout your session but is not saved between sessions.
