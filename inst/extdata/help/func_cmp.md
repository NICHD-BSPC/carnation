#### Compare results controls
-----------------------------

Main controls to compare functional enrichment analyses

Results are organized in three levels:
- `Comparison 1` & `Comparison 2`: differential expression comparisons to be compared.
- `Direction`: direction of change in the DE genes
  - Note that different effect classes within the same comparison can be compared.
- `Database`: annotation database used for the analysis,
  e.g. Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, etc.
- `Swap comparisons` & `Swap directions` buttons can be used to swap
  `Comparison 1` & `Comparison 2` or the direction of change.

- *Note:* Any change in the main controls are immediately reflected
  in the plot.

*Plot options* shows options specific to each plot.
- `Refresh plot` button redraws the plot after plot options are updated.
