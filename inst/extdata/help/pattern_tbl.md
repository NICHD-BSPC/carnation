#### Pattern Analysis - Cluster Membership Table
------------------------------------------------

Interactive table showing gene cluster membership and expression patterns across experimental conditions.

**What it shows:**
- Genes grouped by similar expression patterns
- Cluster assignments at different resolution levels
- Gene identifiers and descriptions

**When to use it:**
- To explore which genes belong to specific expression pattern clusters
- To identify co-regulated genes with similar temporal profiles
- To export gene lists from specific clusters for downstream analysis

**How to interpret:**
- Each row represents a gene
- The `cluster` column shows the cluster assignment at the selected resolution
- Genes in the same cluster share similar expression patterns across conditions
- Additional columns provide gene identifiers and functional annotations

**Interactive features:**
- Choose column to cluster by using the `Cluster column` dropdown menu. Then
  use the `Clusters to show` menu to filter the table to show specific cluster(s).
- Search for specific genes using the search box
- Sort by any column to organize results
- Export cluster gene lists for pathway analysis
