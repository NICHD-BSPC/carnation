### DE Analysis Table Controls
------------------------------

- `Comparison`: Select comparison(s) to show differential expression results
  - You can select one or more comparisons to view results for multiple contrasts at once.
    This is helpful to see, e.g. if your favorite gene is DE in all comparisons.
  - Use `Select all` or `Select none` to quickly select or deselect all comparisons.
- `Only DE genes`: Toggle on to filter the table based on the selected FDR and LFC thresholds.
