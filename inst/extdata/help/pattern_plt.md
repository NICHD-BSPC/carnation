#### Pattern analysis plot
--------------------------

Visualize the results of pattern analysis using the `DEGreport` package based on hierarchical clustering to find
groups of genes showing similar trends.
- *This is useful for time-series or dose-response experiments, that have a temporal component,
  to look for predominant patterns of gene expression.*
