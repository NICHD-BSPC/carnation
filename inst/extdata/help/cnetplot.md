#### Cnetplot
-------------

Network visualization showing the associations of genes with multiple functional terms
or pathways.
- *This plot is good for identifying which genes act as links between which categories.*
- Node size represents the number of genes associated with the functional terms.

**Plot options**
- `# of terms`: The number of top functional terms to be shown on the plot (default=5).
- `node label`: what labels to be used for nodes. Options are:
  - `all`: category and gene names (default)
  - `category`: category name only
  - `gene`: gene name only
  - `none`: no labels
- `max name length`: Maximum number of characters for term names (default=50).
- `color edge by terms`: toggle to color edges by term names.
- `circular layout`: toggle to show plot with circular layout.
