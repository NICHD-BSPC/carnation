#### Enrichment table controls
------------------------------

Main controls to view functional enrichment analysis

Results are organized in three levels:
- `Comparison`: differential expression comparison that yielded
  the DE gene set being analyzed
  - In the `Compare results` tab, this is replaced by `Comparison 1` and `Comparison 2`
    to select results to be compared.
- `Effect class`: direction of change in the DE genes
- `Database`: annotation database used for the analysis,
  e.g. Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, etc.

**Note:**

- Changes in the above controls are also reflected in the `Plots` tab.
- Any change in the main controls are immediately reflected
  in the plot.

*More options:*

- `Genes per line`: Number of genes to be shown per line in the table.
- `# of terms`: Number of terms to be used for `Distill enrichment`
  or `Fuzzy clustering`.
