#### Cluster filters
--------------------

- `Cluster column`: same control as in plot options
  - Use this menu to see results from *cuts* at different
    heights of the clustering dendrogram.
  - Cluster column names start with `cutoff` and are followed by a number denoting the height of the
    cut.
  - *Smaller numbers correspond to lower cuts and finer/smaller clusters and vice-versa.*
  - The final level of the cut is displayed by default (`cluster`).
- `Clusters to show`
  - use this menu to filter the table to show specific cluster(s)
  - `Select all` and `Select none` buttons can be used to easily reset/empty
    the list of clusters shown on the table.
