#### Enrichment Plot Controls
-----------------------------

Main controls for visualizing functional enrichment analysis results.

**What it controls:**
- Selection of comparison, direction, and database for visualization
- Plot type and plot-specific options
- Visual parameters for the current enrichment visualization

**Key components:**
- `Comparison`: Select the differential expression comparison to analyze
- `Direction`: Choose the direction of change (up, down, or both)
- `Database`: Select the annotation database (GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc.)

**Available visualizations:**
- *Summary overview*: Bar chart of top enriched terms
- *Enrichment map*: Network visualization of related terms
- *Cnetplot*: Network of genes and their associated terms
- *Radar plot*: Circular visualization of enrichment significance
- *Alluvial plot*: Sankey diagram showing gene-term relationships
- *Dendrogram*: Hierarchical clustering of related terms

**How to use:**
- Select your comparison, direction, and database
- Choose a visualization type from the dropdown menu
- Adjust plot-specific options as needed
- Click "Refresh plot" to apply changes to plot options

**Note:** Changes to the main controls (comparison, direction, database) are immediately reflected in both the plot and table views.
