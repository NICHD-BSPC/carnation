#### Enrichment plot controls
-----------------------------

Main controls to view functional enrichment analysis

Results are organized in three levels:
- `Comparison`: differential expression comparison that yielded
  the DE gene set being analyzed
- `Effect class`: direction of change in the DE genes
- `Database`: annotation database used for the analysis,
  e.g. Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, etc.

**Note:**

- Changes in these controls are also reflected in the `Table` tab.
- Any change in the main controls are immediately reflected
  in the plot.

*Plot options* shows options specific to each plot.
- `Refresh plot` button redraws the plot after plot options are updated.
