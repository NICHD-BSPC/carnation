#### More options
-----------------

- `cluster column`
  - This dropdown shows results from *cuts* at different
    heights of the clustering dendrogram.
  - Cluster column names start with `cutoff` and are followed by a number denoting the height of the
    cut.
  - *Smaller numbers correspond to lower cuts and finer/smaller clusters and vice-versa.*
  - The final level of the cut is displayed by default (`cluster`).
- `min cluster size`: minimum cluster size to show on the plot. Increase this to filter out small clusters.
- `rotate x labels`: rotation angle of x-axis labels. Change this to help
  declutter the display.
