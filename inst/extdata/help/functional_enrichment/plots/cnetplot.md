#### Cnetplot
-------------

Network visualization showing the associations of genes with multiple functional terms
or pathways.
- *This plot is good for identifying which genes act as links between which categories.*
- Node size represents the number of genes associated with the functional terms.
- `Node labels` can be used to depict category and gene names (`all`), either `category` or `gene`
  names or turned off altogether.
- By default, the top 5 categories are plotted. This can be adjusted using the `# of terms` control
  in the sidebar.
- Users can also `color edge by terms` or depict the network with a `circular layout`.
