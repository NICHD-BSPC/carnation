#### Enrichment map
-------------------

Interactive network visualization of the enrichment analysis.

- *This plot is good for identifying similarities between enriched terms, since terms with shared genes*
  *will cluster together.*
- Nodes in the network represent functional terms and the connections (edges) between nodes represent shared genes
between the terms.
- The color of the nodes corresponds to p-values.
- The size of nodes represent the number of DE genes associated with the term.
- The thickness of the edge represents the number of genes shared between the terms.
- By default the top 30 categories are shown. This can be adjusted using the `# of terms` control.
