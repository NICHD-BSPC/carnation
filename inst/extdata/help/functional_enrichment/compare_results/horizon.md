#### Horizon
------------

An alternative to the `summary_overview` plot where functional terms shared by two comparisons
are plotted side-by-side with terms corresponding to each comparison connected by solid lines.
- The default sorting (`clustered`) orders top shared terms according to the comparisons for
  which they have lower p-values. Sorting by `first_set` gives precedence to `Comparison 1`
  as in the other plots.
