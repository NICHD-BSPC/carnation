#### Functional enrichment controls
-----------------------------------

Main controls to view functional enrichment analysis

Results are organized in three levels:
- `Comparison`: differential expression comparison that yielded
  the DE gene set being analyzed
  - In the `Compare results` tab, this is replaced by `Comparison 1` and `Comparison 2`
    to select results to be compared.
- `Effect class`: direction of change in the DE genes
- `Database`: annotation database used for the analysis,
  e.g. Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, etc.
