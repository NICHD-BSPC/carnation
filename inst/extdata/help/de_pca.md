#### Interactive PCA plot
-------------------------

Interactive plot to visualize the variation of samples in the analysis using PCA

- Mousing over the points in the plot will show the sample ID.
- The controls at the top right hand corner can be used to pan,
  zoom or save a snapshot of the plot.
- The plot can be colored using all variables available in the
  experimental metadata including custom columns.
  - This control also accepts multiple selections at once. For example, if an experiment has `genotype` and
    `treatment` factors, coloring by both will set different colors for all combinations of the two factors.
- The `gene loadings` menu in the sidebar allows us to overlay top gene loadings onto the PCA plot.
- A PDF version of the current view can also be downloaded using
  the `Download` button.
