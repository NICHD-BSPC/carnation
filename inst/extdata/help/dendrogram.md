Tree visualization showing hierarchical clustering of functional terms. This is an alternative to
enrichment maps to group terms based on shared genes.
- Color of the leaves represent z-scores.
- Size of leaves represent p-values associated with the term.
- Color of the branches represent different clusters.

**Plot options**
- `# of terms`: The number of terms to be shown on the plot (default=30).
- `max name length`: Maximum number of characters for term names shown on y-axis (default=50).
