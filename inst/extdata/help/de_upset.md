#### UpSet Plot
---------------

Visualization of intersections between multiple differentially expressed gene sets.

**What it shows:**
- Size of each gene set intersection (top panel)
- Size of individual gene sets (left bars)
- Specific intersections between gene sets (connected dots)

**When to use it:**
- To identify genes shared across multiple comparisons
- To discover unique gene signatures for specific conditions
- To explore complex relationships between different DE gene sets

**How to interpret:**
- The top panel shows the size of each intersection
- The left panel shows the total size of each gene set
- Connected dots in the bottom panel indicate which gene sets are part of each intersection
- A single dot represents genes unique to that gene set
- Multiple connected dots represent genes shared between those specific gene sets

**Interactive features:**
- Select specific intersections using the sidebar controls
- View genes from your Gene scratchpad in the context of these intersections
- Filter gene sets based on FDR and log2FC thresholds

**Note:** Changes to the FDR and LFC thresholds affect all DE analysis visualizations.
