#### Metadata Table
------------------

Interactive table displaying sample information and experimental design details.

**What it shows:**
- Sample identifiers and grouping variables
- Experimental conditions and batch information
- Technical metadata about sequencing and processing

**When to use it:**
- To verify sample groupings and experimental design
- To identify potential batch effects or confounding variables
- To understand the relationship between samples and conditions

**How to interpret:**
- Each row represents a sample in your dataset
- Columns represent different metadata variables
- Categorical variables define experimental groups
- Numerical variables may represent technical metrics

**Interactive features:**
- Sort by any column by clicking the column header
- Filter samples using the search box
- Export the metadata table for reference
- Add custom columns to the metadata using the `Edit metadata` controls.

**Note:** The metadata displayed here comes from the sample information provided during the initial data import. This information is used throughout the application for grouping and coloring samples in visualizations.
